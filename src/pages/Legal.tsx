          VeritEd shall not in any way be liable to you or any other party for

        <p className="m-0">
          You understand that we are a platform dedicated to linking tutors with
          students and are not recognized by any country, city, or state as a
          teaching or tutoring business. Under no circumstances will VeritEd be
          held liable for the loss of funds/resources that a user might suffer.

          While we have done our best to verify the authenticity of all tutors
          and their ability to teach the subjects they claim that they can, you
          accept that we will not be responsible for any falsehood perpetrated
          by any tutor or for any tutor’s inability to teach the subject he or
          she claims to be able to teach. All students and their families have
          the responsibility of verifying the authenticity of any tutor’s claims
          before hiring such a tutor. We will, therefore, not be liable for any
          tutor's inability to deliver on his promises.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          We are not guaranteeing that any student or the family will be able to
          pay tutors any agreed amounts, and will not be responsible to any
          tutor for the inability of any student to make payment for services
          rendered as and when due.

        <p className="m-0">ARBITRATION</p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          You and VeritEd agree that all disputes that may arise shall be
          resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the Consumer
          Procedures and Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          This means that you are accepting that there will be no form of class
          action during and after our relationship, and that all disputes will
          be resolved on an individual arbitration basis.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          You are also accepting that all disputes brought to arbitration may
          not be consolidated or joined in arbitration with disputes brought by
          or against any third party unless agreed to in writing by all parties.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">INJUNCTION</p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          You agree that any material violation of these terms and conditions
          will result in irreversible harm to VeritEd for which damages may be
          an insufficient remedy.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          You, therefore, agree that VeritEd will be eligible for reasonable
          relief, including both a permanent and preliminary injunction, if such
          a violation occurs, in addition to our remedies and rights otherwise
          available at law.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          You thereby waive any requirement for the posting of a security such
          as a bond if VeritEd seeks such an injunction.
        </p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0"> SEVERABILITY</p>
        <p className="m-0"></p>
        <p className="m-0">
          You and VeritEd both agree to revise and rewrite the one (or more)
          provision(s) adjudged to be invalid or unenforceable by a United
          States court so as to reflect the original intention of that
          provision. All remaining provisions of this agreement shall thereafter
          remain in full force and effect.
